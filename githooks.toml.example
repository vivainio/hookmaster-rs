# Example githooks.toml configuration file
# This file defines commands to run for different git hooks
# Place this file in your repository root and customize as needed

# Run before each commit - good for formatting and linting
pre-commit = "cargo fmt --check && cargo clippy -- -D warnings"

# Run before pushing - good for running tests
pre-push = "cargo test --all"

# Empty string means the hook does nothing (but hookmaster still handles prepare-commit-msg)
commit-msg = ""

# You can also define custom commands for other hooks
# post-commit = "echo 'Commit completed!'"

# For Python projects:
# pre-commit = "black --check . && flake8 ."
# pre-push = "pytest"

# For Node.js projects:
# pre-commit = "npm run lint && npm run format:check"
# pre-push = "npm test && npm run build"

# For mixed projects:
# pre-commit = "make lint"
# pre-push = "make test"
